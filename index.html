        <h1>Talia Berler</h1>

        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Talia is currently a junior at the University of Miami pursuing a BA 
        in computer science with a minor in journalism. She hopes to obtain 
        a masters in Data Science in the future. She is passionate about her
        family and friends, her cats, soccer, and poetry. </p>

        <h3>Early Life</h3>

        <p>Despite calling Miami home, Talia was born in Ithaca, NY and spent
        the first 8 years of her life in suburban Atlanta, GA. Due to 
        financial circumstances caused by the 2008 recession, her
        family packed up and moved to Miami before she started 3rd
        grade at Coconut Grove Elementary.</p>

        <p>Talia quickly excelled in school, being promoted to the gifted program 
        for the remainder of elementary school. She then attended Ransom Everglades
        School for middle and high school, where her mother teaches history 
        and her siblings and cousins also received their educations. </p>

        <h3>Adulthood (So Far)</h3>

        <p>The 2020 pandemic struck in March of her senior year of highschool, 
        resulting in a graduation on the couch and far too much time at 
        home. This period did however provide ample time to explore her 
        interest in poetry and writing. </p>

        <p>Talia started college at Georgetown University, which remained online for 
        the entirety of her freshman year. After finally living on-campus in
        the fall of 2021, a growing disillusionment with the school, in addition
        to health challenges and personal circumstances, led Talia to take a 
        semester off to change course.</p>

        <p>After a summer of reflection and growth, Talia now contentedly continues her
        studies at the University of Miami. She hopes to develop her data analytics
        abilities, in order to one day apply these skills to fighting inequality,
        promoting sustainability, and improving access to education.</p>

        <h3>How to save your life</h3>
       
        <p>most important, is the instruction manual:<br>
            how to, when to, with what, where<br>
            ever a stickler for rules I<br>
            followed each step, religiously</p>

        <p>the scripture said:<br>
            Education!<br>
            so I beat knowledge into bloodshot eyes<br>
            while the blinking clock watched<br>
            Commitment!<br>
            so I dragged my beaten form to practice<br>
            meetings clubs councils dinners dances dates<br>
            Strength!<br>
            so I propped my empty mass on stilts<br>
            to animate the strained machine</p>

        <p>But<br>
            Then<br>
            I broke down.<br>
            And there was no manual for that.</p>
           
        <p>God vanished.<br>
            Religion failed.<br>
            Nothing mattered<br>
            matters<br>
            will matter,<br>
            Yet we live.</p>

        <p>So I sought joy.</p>

        <p>I fumigated the shattered body<br>
            filled it with poison to kill the sickness<br>
            moved intentionally fluidly with music and nature<br>
            was my cocoon my baptism the rain<br>
            performed my ablutions the birds sang<br>
            prayer electricity drew the ridges in the sky<br>
            sparked curiosity in the circuit board lit<br>
            the headlights and<br>
            I<br>
            saw<br>
            Truth.</p>

        <p>The machine killed the soft animal.<br>
            The structure was her cage.</p>

        <p>From grief, I drew love;<br>
            That set us free.</p>
