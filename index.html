        <h1>Talia Berler</h1>

        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Talia is currently a junior at the University of Miami pursuing a BA 
        in computer science with a minor in journalism. She hopes to obtain 
        a masters in Data Science in the future. She is passionate about her
        family and friends, her cats, soccer, and poetry. </p>

        <h3>Early Life</h3>

        <p>Despite calling Miami home, Talia was born in Ithaca, NY and spent
            the first 8 years of her life in suburban Atlanta, GA. Due to 
            financial circumstances caused by the 2008 recession, her
            family packed up and moved to Miami before she started 3rd
            grade at Coconut Grove Elementary.
        </p>

        <p>Talia quickly excelled in school, being promoted to the gifted program 
            for the remainder of elementary school. She then attended Ransom Everglades
            School for middle and high school, where her mother teaches history 
            and her siblings and cousins also received their educations. 
        </p>

        <h3>Adulthood (So Far)</h3>

        <p>The 2020 pandemic struck in March of her senior year of highschool, 
            resulting in a graduation on the couch and far too much time at 
            home. This period did however provide ample time to explore her 
            interest in poetry and writing.
