        <h3>How to save your life</h3>
       
        <p>Most important, is the instruction manual:<br>
            how to, when to, with what, where<br>
            ever a stickler for rules I<br>
            followed each step, religiously</p>

        <p>The scripture said:<br>
            Education!<br>
            so I beat knowledge into bloodshot eyes<br>
            while the blinking clock watched<br>
            Commitment!<br>
            so I dragged my beaten form to practice<br>
            meetings clubs councils dinners dances dates<br>
            Strength!<br>
            so I propped my empty mass on stilts<br>
            to animate the strained machine</p>

        <p>But<br>
            Then<br>
            I broke down.<br>
            And there was no manual for that.</p>
           
        <p>God vanished.<br>
            Religion failed.<br>
            Nothing mattered<br>
            matters<br>
            will matter,<br>
            Yet we live.</p>

        <p>So I sought joy.</p>

        <p>I fumigated the shattered body<br>
            filled it with poison to kill the sickness<br>
            moved intentionally fluidly with music and nature<br>
            was my cocoon my baptism the rain<br>
            performed my ablutions the birds sang<br>
            prayer electricity drew the ridges in the sky<br>
            sparked curiosity in the circuit board lit<br>
            the headlights and<br>
            I<br>
            saw<br>
            Truth.</p>

        <p>The machine killed the soft animal,<br>
            structure was her cage.</p>

        <p>From grief, I drew love;<br>
            that set us free.</p> -->
