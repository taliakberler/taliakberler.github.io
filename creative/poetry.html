            <h1>Poetry</h1>

            <p>Most of my life has been painted in only rich technicolor or dry black and white. The world inside my head often feels too massive to carry around. Writing lets me open that valve a bit and release some of the pressure. Here are a few pieces I've written to give myself peace.</p>

                <h2>How to save your life</h2>
            
                <p>Most important, is the instruction manual:<br>
                    how to, when to, with what, where<br>
                    ever a stickler for rules I<br>
                    followed each step, religiously</p>

                <p>The scripture said:<br>
                    Education!<br>
                    so I beat knowledge into bloodshot eyes<br>
                    while the blinking clock watched<br>
                    Commitment!<br>
                    so I dragged my beaten form to practice<br>
                    meetings clubs councils dinners dances dates<br>
                    Strength!<br>
                    so I propped my empty mass on stilts<br>
                    to animate the strained machine</p>

                <p>But<br>
                    Then<br>
                    I broke down.<br>
                    And there was no manual for that.</p>
                
                <p>God vanished.<br>
                    Religion failed.<br>
                    Nothing mattered<br>
                    matters<br>
                    will matter,<br>
                    Yet we live.</p>

                <p>So I sought joy.</p>

                <p>I fumigated the shattered body<br>
                    filled it with poison to kill the sickness<br>
                    moved intentionally fluidly with music and nature<br>
                    was my cocoon my baptism the rain<br>
                    performed my ablutions the birds sang<br>
                    prayer electricity drew the ridges in the sky<br>
                    sparked curiosity in the circuit board lit<br>
                    the headlights and<br>
                    I<br>
                    saw<br>
                    Truth.</p>

                <p>The machine killed the soft animal,<br>
                    structure was her cage.</p>

                <p>From grief, I drew love;<br>
                    that set us free.</p>

                <h2>Decision</h2>

                <p>I’ve decided to cut my heart out.<br>
                I think a butchers knife will do.<br>
                A mockingbirds song leaks in<br>
                Stirring debris long settled,<br>
                Perhaps not so long.<br>
                Steady on a shaking perch<br>
                It’s message spans the air and glass,<br>
                Calling out in a void<br>
                To invisible compatriots’ trusted Absence.</p>

                <p>I’ve decided to cut my heart out.<br>
                I won’t make a mess,<br>
                Sparkling spotless record.<br>
                They’d never even know it went Missing.<br>
                The cherry molasses<br>
                On greedy mouths and veiny eyes,<br>
                And probing fingers.<br>
                Ceaselessly prodded<br>
                The ooze goes on,<br>
                Rather foolish to not stop up the Source.</p>

                <p>I’ve decided to cut my heart out.<br>
                I haven’t felt it in months.<br>
                I’d better check if it’s there.<br>
                Vagrants cloaked beneath obfuscating sheets have left with more<br>
                Before the break of dawn.<br>
                Hard to report a robbery with<br>
                Only an empty space to show;<br>
                The hunters snatch up the memory too,<br>
                poaching traits and innocence.<br>
                A hard ruler to an outstretched hand.</p>

                <p>I’ve decided<br>
                Next time they find the chinks in my Armor<br>
                The blade will fall in<br>
                And the continued piercing in my Chest<br>
                Will make far more sense<br>
                Than whatever hurt before.</p>

                <h2>Night Jasmine Syrup</h2>

                <p>I’d like a man<br>
                To sing me<br>
                A melody<br>
                To pour out his heart<br>
                Only for me to leave<br>
                Puddle-jumping away<br>
                Frog sticks on the shower window<br>
                Don’t be rude! Say hi!<br>
                He greets me in return<br>
                He asks why<br>
                Do the stripes on my arm<br>
                Gleam cherry red<br>
                In the fluorescent light?</p>


                <p>And why<br>
                Do the cicadas sing<br>
                Through the wet blanket dark<br>
                Dripping in night jasmine syrup–<br>
                Thick, ebony<br>
                Orbs dance in five<br>
                Their pores singing scents<br>
                As piercing teeth glide.<br>
                These battleships cut through<br>
                A strong supple sea<br>
                And sticky cherry<br>
                Stains the porcelain<br>
                Sink.</p>

                <h2>Pomp and Circumstance</h2>
                
                <p>It’s a relief, isn’t it?<br>
                You’re all done now.<br>
                Relaxing, isn’t it?<br>
                Go ahead and take your bows!</p>

                <p>Well, I suppose it’s bittersweet, isn’t it?<br>
                You didn’t finish quite how you expected.<br>
                A bit strange, isn’t it?<br>
                You know your experience is the same as the next kid.</p>

                <p>One thing I can confirm,<br>
                Is that I have many questions myself.<br>
                Is this relief?<br>
                Is this bittersweet?<br>
                It does feel strange, but is it fair to complain?</p>

                <p>I can’t answer how I feel.<br>
                Nothing these days feels real.<br>
                I want to curse the world.<br>
                But as I see some miracles unfurl,<br>
                My heart fills with gratitude.<br>
                I just can’t shake this attitude.<br>
                Of loss.<br>
                Of fear.<br>
                Of the incompleteness of our year.<br>
                I ache every day to see the friends I hold dear.</p>

                <p>The class of 2020 does show resilience beyond compare.<br>
                But that in no way means we’ve made peace with the fact<br>
                that this isn’t fair.<br>
                Your questions are kind.<br>
                They show that you care.<br>
                But our answers we have yet to find.<br>
                Give us time, and maybe one day, we’ll share.</p>
